/**
 * Encoding for error/warning/info severity.
 * Error methodology:
 *    o Parse messages either represent errors which must be fixed, have a mechanism to be waived which is reported with the message,
 *      or are from a very limited report.
 *    o \SVX context syntax is very specific.  Different compilers should adhere to it.  Clean code may report WARNINGs that
 *      differ across compilers.  A compiler switch should be available to disable them, but this should not commonly be used.
 *      Instead, the build process should support a mechanism to compare the baseline report vs. the new report and report diffs.
 *      Release should be gated by an increase in warnings.  This avoids warnings getting lost in the clutter and it gives an
 *      incremental path to eliminating warnings from code leveraged from a project using a different compiler or compiler switches.
