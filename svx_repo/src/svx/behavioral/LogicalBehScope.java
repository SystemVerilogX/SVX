		// Algorithm:
		//
		// This method loops over all wildcarded uses in this scope.  So, it loops over wildcarded assignment statements at this scope, and, within that,
		// over wildcarded uses.
		//
		// As this method recurses, it tracks the variables declared above (and assigned below) to break cycles and avoid rediscovery.
		// A scopes search state is initially set to INCONCLUSIVE or CONCLUSIVE, based on the 'conclusive' parameter to this method.
		//
		// We may need two iterations over each wildcarded use in this Assignment.
		// Why?: Uses can be cyclic, meaning their fanin is entirely from scopes we are currently searching through.
		//    If all uses of this wildcarded assignment are cyclic, we have no assignment on these cycles.  There can
		//    however be an assignment that feeds into the cycles.  We don't know.  If any assignment is found,
		//    this is a fruitful wildcarded assignment and the cyclic uses should pull the signal through the cycles.
		//    This scope's search becomes conclusive once the first non-cyclic use is found.
		// So: We search uses "non-aggressively", meaning cycles will not pull signals through, until the searchwe encounter a non-cyclic
		//     one.  We count how many cyclic paths were searched non-aggressively, and on the second
		//     pass, if the first pass was fruitful, we do that many aggressive searches (assuming the iterator order hasn't
		//     changed), and then stop searching.
		
		// 
		// Example:
		//   Pass |                                    Expectation | Found? | cyc_cnt |
		//   -----+------------------------------------------------+--------+---------+------------------------------------------

		//   1st  |                 >scope2$ANY     // ?           | Cyclic | 2       |

	 * The first level invocation determines which one of this scope's wildcarded assignments is fruitful and sets this.fruitful_assignment.
	 *    It sets this.search_status to FINDING_ASSIGN.  It recurses into only and all scopes without assignments of the signal that have this.search_status == NONE (to break cycles).
	 *    It reports an error if multiple fruitful paths are found.  There's some complexity here with cycles.  We are not necessarily able to determine whether cycles are fruitful.  We won't know until the
	 *    signal is pulled through the point of the cycle.  To address this, we track SearchAgainStatus and do another call if necessary from the top level (or we could record the min required search depth, and call from there).
	 * The second invocation traverses fruitful assignments only and pulls the signal through the fanin-graph.  Note that it recurses into the scopes
	 *    with the assignments, that are not marked FINDING_ASSIGN, and returns immediately.  The method does:
	 *    1) It checks to see if the signal and all required bits are already assigned at this scope, in which case we're done.  If not, it should be known which is the fruitful assignment.  If this.fruitful_assignment
	 *       is not already set, this scope must have been involved in a previous search, and there must be an existing assignment that comes from a wildcarded assignment statement, and it is the fruitful assignment.
	 *       If a wildcarded assignment exists, more bits are added to its signal uses and assignments.  Otherwise the wildcarded assignments are created.
	 *    2) Recurse.  TODO: No, must follow fruitful assignments.
	 *    3) In case the search contained a cycle back to this scope that pulled through more bits than
	 *       were requested originally, we invoke this method a second time at this same scope.  This action is also required to take care of a case where a required bound is unevaluated.  In this case, the resulting bound(s) reflect the assignments.  But those from loops do not,
	 *       so another invocation is required requesting the observed assignment (we must know which reflect an original assignment).  The resulting bounds from original assignments are verified to be identical.
     * The third invocation tears down the search by recursively updating this.search_status to NONE and this.fruitful_assignment to null.
     * Because the second-level invocation only traverses fruitful paths, it uses a separate method.
     * @param pull Indicates whether this is a third-level invocation, versus a first-level invocation, and should pull the signal through.

	 * Provide an assignment for the given signal by recursing through the wildcarded assignment fanin and pulling the bits through it.
	 * A scope may have only one wildcarded assignment statement.  At first, an attempt was made to support multiple, but this was found to add considerable complexity.
	 * Report an error if the bits cannot be provided.
	 * 
	 * Unevaluated range bounds: Another source of complexity is support for SV range expressions which cannot be evaluated.  If a required bound cannot be evaluated,
	 * the one from the assignment(s) is used, and all assignments are required and verified to have the same bound.  When the root invocation of this method returns,
	 * for all visited scopes, the signal's reflects_orig_assignment is true, and getIndexHighest/Lowest() is the original assignment(s)'s bound iff the required bound
	 * is unevaluated.
	 * 
	 * Cycles present additional complexity.  Cycles are broken by pulling_sig, which is set during traversal and is used to recognize a cycle and avoid further
	 * traversal.  When a cycle is encountered, there is no original assignment at the leaf of the traversal, and therefore there is no way to know the correct SV
	 * properties to apply to the pulled signal.  Once an original assignment is found in a recursive pull, its SV properties are reflected
	 * in the signal assignment at this scope, and it is passed downstream in the orig_sig argument.  Additional cycle traversals may be required to reflect the
	 * right SV properties (unevaluated bounds and SV type) through the cycle.
	 * 
	 * The steps performed by this method are:
	 *    1) Check to see if the signal and all required bits are already assigned at this scope, in which case we're done.
	 *    2) For each wildcarded use of the wildcarded assignment (if there is one):
	 *        a) Reflect use of this signal as part of the wildcarded use.
	 *        b) Recurse.
	 *        c) Pull SV attributes from the child's original assignment or ensure consistency with those of the child's original assignment.
	 *    4) Do a second recursive call at this scope if the signal's SV properties at this scope changed.  This can happen for one of two reasons:
	 *       a) Different SV attributes were pulled from an original assignment through a wildcarded use (above).
	 *       b) The search contained a cycle back to this scope that used more bits in this scope.
	 *       If a second recursive call is not needed, create or update the assignment of this signal as part of the wildcarded assignment.
	 * 
	 * @param sig The signal in this scope.  This signal reflects the wildcarded use in the calling scope (if not the top-level invocation) and it
	 *            reflects orig_sig if orig_sig is non-null.
	 * @param orig_sig A signal for this flow that reflects the SV properties of an original assignment necessary to know the SV properties
	 *                 for the assignment in this scope.  In other words, it has an SV type from an original assignment and for any required bounds
	 *                 that are unevaluated (SV expression) the bound is from an original assignment.  If non-null, signal assignments below this
	 *                 scope are compared against this.  Note that orig_sig and sig are updated as the wildcarded uses are recursed.
     * @param repeat Indicates whether this is a repeat invocation providing SV properties via orig_sig that were previously unknown.
	 * @param debug Carries debug information about the pull.
	 * @return true if the search led only to cycles.  If false (from recursive call) || orig_sig != null, sig has been updated to reflect SV properties
	 *         of an original assignment for the required bounds, and we can back-propagate them and check them for consistency vs other uses.
